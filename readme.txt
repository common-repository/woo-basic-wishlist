== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I activated the plugin and nothing happens? =

Make sure that WooCommerce is active and it's a recent version.

= Can I customize the wishlist page? =

Yes. This plugin uses the same template override mechanism as normal WooCommerce so you can copy-paste template files from the plugin's templates/ folder into your theme's woocommerce/ folder.

= Wishlist page doesn't show or returns a 404 error? =

Make sure you have a wishlist page set under WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced. The selected page should contain the "[woocommerce_wishlist]" shortcode.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First release of the plugin. Uploaded to WP plugin repo!

= 0.1 =
* Initial version of the plugin. Works fine in all my testing.
